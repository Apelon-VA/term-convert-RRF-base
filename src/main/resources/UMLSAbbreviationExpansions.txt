#UMLS Attribute Types
ACTIVE	Active	
ALT_SORT_CODE	Alt Sort Code	
AQ	Allowable Qualifier	SNOMED CT "allowable qualifier" attribute for representing certain relationships (those having a characteristic type of "Qualifier" and a refinability of "Mandatory") which indicate one of several allowable types of qualifiers, such as laterality or severity, that a concept may have
CASE_SIGNIFICANCE_ID	Case significance ID	
CHARACTERISTICTYPE	Characteristic Type	SNOMED CT indication of whether a relationship specifies a defining characteristic of the source concept or a possible qualification of that Concept.
CHARACTERISTIC_TYPE_ID	Characteristic type ID	
CODE_ALSO	Code Also	Instructs that 2 codes may be required to fully describe a condition but the sequencing of the two codes is discretionary, depending on the severity of the conditions and the reason for the encounter.
CODE_FIRST	Code First	Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first followed by the manifestation. Wherever such a combination exists there is a "code first" note at the manifestation code. These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation. In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, "in diseases classified elsewhere." Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. "In diseases classified elsewhere" codes are never permitted to be used as first listed or principle diagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the underlying condition.
